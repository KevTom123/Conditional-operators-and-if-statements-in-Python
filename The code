Comparison Operators

Comparison operations compare some value or operand and based on a condition, produce a Boolean. When comparing two values you can use these operators:

    equal: ==
    not equal: !=
    greater than: >
    less than: <
    greater than or equal to: >=
    less than or equal to: <=

1)
# Greater than Sign

i = 6
i > 5

2) 
# Inequality Sign

i = 2
i != 6

3)
# Use Equality sign to compare the strings

"ACDC" == "Michael Jackson"

4)
# Compare characters

'B' > 'A'

5)
# If statement example
age = 19
#age = 18

#expression that can be true or false
if age > 18:    
    print("you can enter" )

#The statements after the if statement will run regardless if the condition is true or false 
print("move on")

6)
# Else statement example

age = 18
# age = 19

if age > 18:
    print("you can enter" )
else:
    print("go see Meat Loaf" )
    
print("move on")

7)
# Condition statement example

album_year = 1983
#album_year = 1970

if album_year > 1980:
    print("Album year is greater than 1980")
else:
    print("less than 1980")

print('do something..')
